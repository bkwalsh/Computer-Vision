        "In this assignment, you will practice building and training Convolutional Neural Networks with Pytorch to solve computer vision tasks.  This assignment includes two sections, each involving different tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) Image Classification. Predict image-level category labels on two historically notable image datasets: **CIFAR-10** and **MNIST**.\n",
        "\n",
        "(2) Image Segmentation. Predict pixel-wise classification (semantic segmentation) on synthetic input images formed by superimposing MNIST images on top of CIFAR images.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will design your own models in each section and build the entire training/testing pipeline with PyTorch. \n",
        "PyTorch provides optimized implementations of the building blocks and additional utilities, both of which will be necessary for experiments on real datasets. It is highly recommended to read the official [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) and [examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) before starting your implementation. There are some APIs that you'll find useful:\n",
